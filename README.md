# TwitchChatForm
My Twitch chat bot.  Written in C# using VS 2015 and Microsoft SQL.

Form1.cs is contains the main program logic.  It needs optimization and comments, but it's in a working state.

Credit to Youtuber and Twitcher Hardly Difficult aka Hardly Sober for his bot tutorial.
The framework of this program was a result of following along with his video.
